# # OpenMKM Input and Output
# This notebook describes pmutt's functionality to write OpenMKM CTI and YAML files. We will use the NH3 formation mechanism as a case study.
# 
# ## Topics Covered
# - Read species *ab-initio* data, reactions, lateral interactions, phases, reactor operating conditions, and desired units from a spreadsheet
# - Write the CTI file that can be read by OpenMKM
# - Write a YAML file that can be read by OpenMKM

# ## Input Spreadsheet
# All the data will be imported from the [`./inputs/NH3_Input_data.xlsx`](https://github.com/VlachosGroup/pMuTT/blob/master/docs/source/examples_jupyter/omkm_io/inputs/NH3_Input_Data.xlsx) file. There are several sheets:
# 
# 1. `units` contains the units that types of quantities should be written
# 2. `refs` contains *ab-initio* and experimental data for a handful of gas species to calculate references (optional)
# 3. `species` contains *ab-initio* data for each specie
# 4. `beps` contains Bronsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships for reactions (optional)
# 5. `reactions` contains elementary steps 
# 6. `lateral_interactions` contains lateral interactions between species (optional)
# 7. `phases` contains phases for the species
# 8. `reactor` contains reactor operating conditions and solver tolerances
# 
# The ``refs``, ``beps`` and ``lateral_interactions`` sheets can be deleted and the code written below should still work.

# First, we change the working directory to the location of the Jupyter notebook.
